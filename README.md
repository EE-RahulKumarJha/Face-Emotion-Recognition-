# Facial Emotion Recognition

Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a computer vision project that involves detecting and classifying human emotions based on facial expressions. This project aims to provide real-time emotion recognition using a trained deep learning model.

## Overview

The repository includes the following components:

- **Model Training:** Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for training the Facial Emotion Recognition model.
- **Real-time Detection:** Code for real-time emotion recognition using a webcam or video source.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (choose one)
- OpenCV
- Other necessary libraries (specified in requirements.txt)

You can install the dependencies using:
